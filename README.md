# i3config
My basic i3 config.
I'm trying to make sure there is as little setup as possible here

## Setup
After cloning this repo, install i3 with your favorite flavor of linux.

```
sudo apt install i3wm
```

Then create a symbolic link to `i3.conf`

```
ln -s ~/Repos/i3config/i3.conf ~/.config/i3/config
```
